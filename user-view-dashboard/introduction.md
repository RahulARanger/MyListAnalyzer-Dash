# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This is a Dashboard mostly used for gaining some information about the user's AnimeList. we can expect that after searching for a required user, you could understand how the user rates animes or picks them on their list and what has the user been up to recently, etc... you can directly jump to [reports ](reports/)for more detailed results.

We can only search for the user who has set their anime list status to the public.
