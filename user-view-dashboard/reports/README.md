# 🎆 Reports

Based on the data fetched, MyListAnalyzer will now analyze the data to give you a brief introduction to the User's Animelist.&#x20;

Results are now based on [_Descriptive analytics_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], which could give you an overview / brief introduction to the Requested Users' Animelist. It is better to first understand the facts / some events before proceeding with the deeper level of analytics.

You can go through the various tabs. Results are processed if you are selecting the tab for the first time.
