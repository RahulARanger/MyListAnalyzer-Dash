### My Habits - Skip this

Below are some random sentences. You can read them if you feel they can match with the results above.

I would like to watch animes which has episodes from 12 - 24. I might have added <12 mostly because there are either OVA, Specials related to some show.&#x20;

I do drop animes but I don't keep mark them "dropped" in my list, I either don't add them to my list or I would just mark it as "On Hold". Not because they are bad, but because I feel "What am I even watching ?". Will try them after trying some more animes.

I don't watch large shows mostly because they are too nice and end too quickly, I end up watching 24 episodes per day missing some classes. In order to maintain my life, For now avoiding them.&#x20;

My Highest were [Gintama ](https://myanimelist.net/anime/918/Gintama)and [Bleach](https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach). would rewatch after sometime. I planned those in my summer holidays.
