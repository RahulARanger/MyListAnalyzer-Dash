# ðŸª— My Anime List - Login

The [home page](https://rahularanger.vercel.app/MLA) begins with the Login button for the MyAnimeList, which as of now not required but could be helpful in the feature run.

If you are logged in,

* The application can make certain updates to your list
* In case, if your anime list is private, you have cannot access certain sections that rely on your anime list for results. in that case, you can log in with your account and access those modules. [_\[1\]_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]__

[^1]: This scenario is a theory and was not tested. Please let me know if this did not work as expected.
